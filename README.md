## Welcome to _fractally_!

Fractally aims to house a collection of cool-looking fractals generated using code. Currently, the work is done in **p5.js** and will be so for the near future. Use the index below to browse to different fractal generators.

(P.S. - If you're viewing this on a mobile, _landscape orientations work better!_ So turn on auto-rotate if this is the case, and **refresh the browser**!)

- #### [Custom polygonal fractals (ft. The Chaos Game)](./arbipolyfrac/arbipolyfrac.html) :
  > Employs the **'Chaos Game'** algorithm. Pin your own points on the canvas, play with the settings and see a fractal in the making! Since these fractals are generated by random numbers, it might take time to generate one.
